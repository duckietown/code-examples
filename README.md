# Code Examples

This repository is a collection of simple DTProjects that you can use as a starting point for the development of more complex behaviors for your Duckietown robots. For further information about what a DTProject is and how to use it, we suggest you follow 
the [official tutorial](https://docs.duckietown.com/daffy/devmanual-software/beginner/dtproject/index.html).


## Content

Examples in this repository are implemented as independent DTProjects. These are then grouped together by framework.
Each project is built and executed the same way, the only thing that changes is the content of their `packages/` 
directory, which is the place where the specific behavior is implemented.

A detailed list of the examples stored in this repository follows,


## ROS1
